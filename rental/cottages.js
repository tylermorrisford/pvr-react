        cottageDescription: "Located 25 minutes from the Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes and National Lake Shore Park that was voted The Most Beautiful Place in America in 2011, this summer home is roomy, clean, comfortable, well equipped, well maintained and unique. A second floor balcony surrounds the first floor on three sides creating a two-story great room with a beautiful stone wall fireplace. The house is designed so that the lake is visible from most of the first floor rooms; the living and dining rooms, the master bedroom and the kitchen. Rooms on the second floor open to the balcony which also allows great water views. Most of the bedrooms have new beds and mattresses. To check outdoor amenities, just slide open the door wall in the dining room, move to the porch and down to the lawn, then sink tired feet into the sand on the beach before testing the lake water with its firm, sandy bottom. The lake is shallow a good distance out making this a great area for supervising children’s summer fun. \nThere is a dock and a mooring station to which you can moor your boat. It could also be a great place to soak up the warm sun and dangle toes in the water. \nLazy days in the sun, swimming, fishing, and boating move to evenings by the fire watching the sunset. This is the perfect setting to enjoy family time, to relax, to laugh and to play together. Secluded on a private road, you are centrally located to explore the many attractions that surround you. Create your summer memories at Maria’s Sunset Shore.",
